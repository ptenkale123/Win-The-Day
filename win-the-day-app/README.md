The 'Win The Day' app allows users to keep track of their 'Power List' in every single day. The 'Power List' is 5 critical daily tasks that will help them build good habits and improve themselves.
If you complete all 5 tasks on the list, that day is counted as a 'win' in the books. Otherwise, that day is counted as a 'loss'. 
The goal is to achieve a winning record over the course of many months so that you are taking steps every single week to you bring you closer to your foals.

The concept was based off a podcast by entrepreneur and bestselling Andy Frisella:

The Web App was made with the MERN (MondoDb, Express, React, Node) stack 

If you are using the bash scripts to run the app, the backend API which connects to MongoDb that will be running on port 3000 and frontend web server with all the react code will be on port 4569.

You would have to open two terminals to run the backend and frontend simultaneously.
